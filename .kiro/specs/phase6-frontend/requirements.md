## Introduction

MAGIsystemのフェーズ6フロントエンド機能は、ユーザーがWebインターフェースを通じてMAGIシステムと対話できるようにするフロントエンドアプリケーションです。この機能により、ユーザーは直感的なUIを通じてシステムの各種機能にアクセスし、データの可視化、操作、管理を行うことができます。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the MAGI system through a web interface, so that I can interact with the system without needing technical knowledge of the backend APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the application URL THEN the system SHALL display a responsive web interface
2. WHEN the web interface loads THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user session
3. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to a login page
4. WHEN the user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL display the main dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view system status and data visualizations on a dashboard, so that I can monitor the current state of the MAGI system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time system status indicators
2. WHEN system data is available THEN the system SHALL render interactive charts and graphs
3. WHEN data updates occur THEN the system SHALL refresh visualizations automatically
4. IF data loading fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between different sections of the application, so that I can access various MAGI system functionalities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on navigation elements THEN the system SHALL route to the appropriate page
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain user session state
3. WHEN on any page THEN the system SHALL highlight the current active navigation item
4. IF a route is invalid THEN the system SHALL display a 404 error page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with MAGI system data through forms and controls, so that I can configure and manage system parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a form THEN the system SHALL validate input data
2. WHEN form validation passes THEN the system SHALL send data to the backend API
3. WHEN API calls succeed THEN the system SHALL display success confirmation
4. IF API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
5. WHEN forms are loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and performant, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL render within 3 seconds on standard connections
2. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
3. WHEN network is slow THEN the system SHALL show loading states and progress indicators
4. WHEN images or assets load THEN the system SHALL optimize for performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates and notifications, so that I can stay informed about system changes and events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL push notifications to connected clients
2. WHEN notifications are received THEN the system SHALL display them in a non-intrusive manner
3. WHEN multiple notifications exist THEN the system SHALL queue and manage them appropriately
4. WHEN the user dismisses notifications THEN the system SHALL remove them from the display
